<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This repo is code for a machine learning social &quot;turing&quot; test run on Clubhouse.
It's a conversational bot that leverages GPT-3 to reply contextually to speakers in Clubhouse topics. It uses Google Speech to translate peoples audio responses into text. (&quot;speech to text&quot;) The text is then sent to GPT-3 with a default prompt (personality). The bot also contains multiple variations of &quot;personalities&quot;, it tries to redirect responses from speakers in Clubhouse to an appropriate personality. In the GPT-3 prompt this codebase is configured to inject primitive &quot;memories&quot; that are generated by calls to GPT-3 through it's classification methodology. (in some lazy attempt to make the &quot;personalities&quot; evolve over time)
Once GPT-3 replies with a textual response, it triggers Omega to do &quot;text-to-speech&quot; that plays the audio stream into Clubhouse. The output voice is generated by Google speech and configured to use the &quot;personalities&quot; speech profile. The file is saved, then streamed back through the local computers audio device routing through the virtual audio device. (VB - Audio Control)
At this point, people in clubhouse should be able to have a back and fourth with GPT-3.</p>
